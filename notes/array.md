# Arrays
They are fixed size, continiguous memory chunks

That means you cannot grow it
There is no "insertAt" or push or pop. Doesn't mean you can't write those though.
const a = []; is not an array. 

## Binary search
In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.

## Bubble sort 
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed
